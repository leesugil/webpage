	<h2>Drawing a Surface</h2>
	
	<p>
	Let's talk about a computer graphics algorithm!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For many years as a calculus instructor at a college, I've been hoping to code my own graphics library for teaching purposes. Of course many softwares already support fantastic graphing features, but I always wanted a light, free, and customizable way to draw curves and surfaces.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	So I picked up WebGL, more specifically <a href="threejs.org">the THREE.js module</a>, to start developing my own graphics library. It's going to be clumsy in the beginning, but the whole process of learning computer graphics itself is absolutely enjoyable and one of the things that I've always wanted to achieve.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Graphing a single-variable function $y = f(x)$ isn't that difficult as the domain is just a line segment. The real challenging part starts when graphing a function of two variable $z = f(x, y)$, where the domain is now in a plane.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Here is everyone's first attempt, plotting over a rectangular region.
	</p>
	
	<div style="text-align: center; z-index: -1">
		<div id="canvas1"></div>
		A graph of $z = \sin \bigg( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \bigg)$.
	</div>
	
	<p>
	This will serve its purpose, namely observing the behavior of the function, but I'm not completely happy with the four corners necessarily coming from the choice of a rectangular domain.
	Could we remove them to make it look like a smooth-edged picture from a calculus textbook?
	</p>
	
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<div id="canvas2"></div>
		The cinnamon role, a failed attempt.
	</div>
	
	<p>
	A naive attempt that would obviously not work well with computers is to put an arbitrary restriction on $(x, y)$ like humans do. For example, to pick out the part $f(x, y) > 0$, I would impose a condition on $(x, y)$ such that, whenever
	$$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > \pi,$$
	let $z = -1$, hoping that you would then be able to place a horizontal plane $z = 0$ to create a nice cutting edge of the intersection.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	This is obviously not a great idea because every process in the middle - the choice of the boundary restriction on $(x, y)$, the level $z = -1$, and the placement of a horizontal plane - was too arbitrary. And the resulting graph doesn't even look pretty!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Stating an object using mathematical symbols doesn't make it mathematical. What should be the correct way to handle the annoying rectangular domain? Well, believe it or not, we've all seen the technique in vector calculus.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This is exactly the case of a parametrization of a surface. We can map a rectangular region to a desired region as a parametric surface
	$$(u, v) \longmapsto (x(u, v), y(u, v), 0) \in \mathbb{R^3}.$$
	The image region then could have an arbitrary shape depending on how we define $x = x(u, v)$ and $y = y(u, v)$, and we should use it as the domain when rendering the graph of $z = f(x, y)$!
	</p>
	
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<div id="canvas3"></div>
		$\{ (x, y, z) \ | \ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 36, \ z \geq 1 \}$
	</div>
	
	<p>
	Smooth parametrization is how we give Euclidean coordinate patches to a shape. And the theories from differential geometry apply here when it comes to determining the size of each coordinate patch.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	For example, the graph of $z = f(x, y)$ can be understood as the level curve $F(x, y, z) = 0$ where
	$$F(x, y, z) = z - f(x, y).$$
	Then the corresponding normal vector $\nabla F$ determines a coordinate patch at each point. Having a normal vector correctly calculated to the surface at a point is not only important in theories but also in application. Normal vectors are used in determining the orientation of a surface which, in computer graphics, gives a rendering criterion, light reflection, shadowing, etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	But the normal vector of $F = 0$
	$$\nabla F = <-f_x, -f_y, 1>$$
	does not make sense at singular points like when $z = 0$ in our sphere case. ($f_x, f_y$ to the infinity!)
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Thus I chose the restriction
	$$z \geq 1$$
	to intentionally avoid getting near $z = 0$.
	</p>
	
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<div id="canvas4"></div>
		An example of a failed calculation of vertices or normal vectors near $z = 0$.
	</div>
	
	<p>
	In theory, we choose multiple coordinate patches to cover a manifold, and the depiction of an arbitrary surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ could be achieved as a direct application of it.
	Commercial graphing softwares should have better algorithms for drawing a general parametric surface, but a direct application of textbook calculus could yield a reasonably acceptable prototype.
