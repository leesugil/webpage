	<h2>Perlin Noise</h2>

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin noise</a> is a noise-generating algorithm invented by Ken Perlin in 1983 and has been one of the most popular algorithms to generate a noise that is "smoothly random."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	It is particularly useful in computer graphics, especially in terrain-generation, because, unlike a pure random sequence representing unrealistic up and down of the height of a terrain, a random sequence generated by Perlin noise shows that the close numbers have similar heights, though they transit smoothly so that we still gain a long-term random fluctuation.

	</p>

	There are many articles on the Internet that explains the algorithm as it's been incredibly popular (and it is not-so-challenging to comprehend), so I'll skil the explanation this time until I feel necessary in the future. Basically it uses a vector field on a lattice (called gradient vectors) to determine the general tendancy of the pattern, whereas the gradation effect (the "smooth" transition of brightness) is obtained by a choice of an interpolation function.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Compare this to a 2-dimensional array made out of purely random brightness.

	</p>
	
	<p>
	This one requires a random number per each pixel, which is a lot more than the number of random vectors we needed on a lattice in Perlin noise. That's why it looks a lot more chaotic, whereas a Perlin noise has a smooth transition between sparse random values.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This is like off-the-topic of what I've been doing, but I recently got into procedually generated terrain maps and wrote a simple code for Perlin noise, so I thought <i>'Why not posting it on my web page?'</i>
