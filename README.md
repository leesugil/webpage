## Some Images

How should we remove the four corners in the image

generated when using double `for` loops for plotting like

```
for (x = -5; x < 5; x += dx) {
  for (y = -5; y < 5; y += dy) {
    plot(x, y, f(x, y));
  }
}
```

when the intended image should have a smoother domain like the following?

This is related to one of the subjects that I taught in calculus at Michigan State University.
